# Codex CLI — session-start marker (contribution wanted)

**Target client:** Codex CLI (`id: 'codex'` in the console's `web/src/lib/clients.ts`,
config at `~/.codex/config.toml`).

**Status: stub.** No working hook code ships here yet — see `../README.md`'s "Launch
scope" note: this repo's own conformance work has only ever driven Claude Code and
Copilot CLI live, so a fabricated, never-run template for Codex CLI would read as working
when nobody has verified it.

**Starting hypothesis (unverified):** Codex CLI's own notify/lifecycle hook mechanism
(Codex CLI has historically exposed a `notify` program setting in `config.toml` for
certain lifecycle events), if it offers something equivalent to Claude Code's
`SessionStart` that fires once per fresh session. Check Codex CLI's own current
documentation for its exact current shape before assuming this hypothesis still holds.

**Does Codex CLI's automation surface hold a credential itself?** Unknown — establish
this first. If Codex CLI's hook surface can reach a valid otto-factory MCP credential
directly, prefer a single deterministic script implementing `../README.md`'s
job-lifecycle contract outright. If it can't — the same limitation Claude Code's own
`SessionStart` hook has — `../claude-code/README.md`'s two-actor split (a deterministic
script handing an instruction to the model) is a worked example to adapt, not a mandate;
propose a different mechanism entirely if neither shape fits.

## Contributing this template

Follow `../README.md`'s contribution checklist exactly. In short, a PR adding this
template should be able to tick every box there: name the Codex CLI version tested, name
the exact mechanism used (with a link to Codex CLI's own docs for it), list every
otto-factory MCP tool called and with what arguments, state plainly whether it was
verified against a real running `of-server` or is an untested hypothesis, and follow the
silent-failure / no-auto-registration / claim-only-what-you-created rules from the
contract.
