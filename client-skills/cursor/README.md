# Cursor — session-start marker (contribution wanted)

**Target client:** Cursor (`id: 'cursor'` in the console's `web/src/lib/clients.ts`,
config at `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or a project's own `.cursor/mcp.json`).

**Status: stub.** No working hook code ships here yet — see `../README.md`'s "Launch
scope" note: this repo's own conformance work has only ever driven Claude Code and
Copilot CLI live, so a fabricated, never-run template for Cursor would read as working
when nobody has verified it.

**Starting hypothesis (unverified):** Cursor's own extension/rules or agent-hook surface,
if it exposes a lifecycle event equivalent to Claude Code's `SessionStart`. Check
Cursor's own current documentation for whatever it currently calls this before assuming
this hypothesis still holds — Cursor's own extensibility surface has changed shape more
than once.

**Does Cursor's automation surface hold a credential itself?** Unknown — establish this
first. If Cursor's hook/extension surface can reach a valid otto-factory MCP credential
directly, prefer a single deterministic script implementing `../README.md`'s
job-lifecycle contract outright. If it can't — the same limitation Claude Code's own
`SessionStart` hook has — `../claude-code/README.md`'s two-actor split (a deterministic
script handing an instruction to the model) is a worked example to adapt, not a mandate;
propose a different mechanism entirely if neither shape fits.

## Contributing this template

Follow `../README.md`'s contribution checklist exactly. In short, a PR adding this
template should be able to tick every box there: name the Cursor version tested, name the
exact mechanism used (with a link to Cursor's own docs for it), list every otto-factory
MCP tool called and with what arguments, state plainly whether it was verified against a
real running `of-server` or is an untested hypothesis, and follow the silent-failure /
no-auto-registration / claim-only-what-you-created rules from the contract.
