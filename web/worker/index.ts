 * `of-server`. The browser talks to exactly one hostname, which is not a
 * performance decision: the console's session is an `HttpOnly`, `__Host-`
 * prefixed cookie, and `__Host-` means the browser refuses to store it unless it
 * is `Secure`, has `Path=/`, and carries no `Domain`. Put the SPA on one
 * hostname and the API on another and that cookie cannot be sent at all — no
 * CORS header rescues it, and the fix would be a different auth transport, which
 * `docs/specs/2026-09-01-otto-factory-design.md` refuses on purpose.
 *
 * This Worker therefore proxies rather than redirects, and it is the reason the
 * split-origin option in the issue was never really an option.
