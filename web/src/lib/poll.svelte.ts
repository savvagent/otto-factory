/**
 * Polling that a page can hand to an `$effect`.
 *
 * Written for the overview — a queue that changes while nobody is touching the
 * browser, on the page most likely to be left open on a second monitor — and
 * kept out of it because the queue and repos pages have the same problem and
 * should not re-derive these rules one at a time.
 *
 * **Why polling, when the server already has a change stream.** `of-core`'s
 * `watch.rs` exists so agents can react to queue changes without polling, and
 * the MCP `watch` tool carries the same data this page reads. The console
 * deliberately does not use it: a stream to the browser would need a new
 * console route in `catalog.rs` and a held connection per open tab, fanned out
 * to readers rather than to agents, for a page whose data is a second stale at
 * worst. Request/response over endpoints that already exist costs nothing new
 * on the server. This is a decision, not an oversight.
 *
 * Six rules, each of which is a way a polling page becomes worse than a static
 * one:
 *
 * 1. **A refresh is not a load.** `loading` is true only while the first result
 *    of a subscription is outstanding. Flipping it on every tick replaces a
 *    working page with a skeleton twice a minute — the numbers are supposed to
 *    change in place.
 * 2. **A failed refresh keeps the last good result** and says how old it is.
 *    `failed`/`error` mean "there is nothing to render"; a failure on top of
 *    data sets `stale` and leaves `value` alone. But see rule 3 — that applies
 *    only to failures worth retrying.
 * 3. **A failure the caller calls `fatal` stops the poll.** A `401` or a `404`
 *    is not a blip: the session or the membership is gone, and a page that
 *    keeps rendering the last good answer under a small warning is asserting
 *    access it no longer has. The classifier is the caller's, because this
 *    module knows nothing about `ApiError`.
 * 4. **A hidden tab does not poll**, and refreshes the moment it is shown
 *    again. The *first* load runs regardless of visibility — a tab opened in
 *    the background should have data ready when it is looked at; it is the
 *    repeat that is suppressed.
 * 5. **Refreshes never overlap, and a failing one backs off.** The interval
 *    runs from the end of one refresh to the start of the next — a chained
 *    `setTimeout`, never `setInterval` — so a slow response delays the next
 *    tick instead of stacking behind it, and consecutive failures widen the gap
 *    so an outage is not met with undiminished pressure from every open tab.
 *    A load that never settles is failed by `timeout`, because a hung `fetch`
 *    would otherwise leave a dead poll wearing a healthy page's face.
 * 6. **A tab nobody has touched for hours parks itself.** `sessions.rs` slides
 *    the browser session's 14-day idle deadline forward on every authenticated
 *    request, which quietly assumes requests imply a human. An open console
 *    tab breaks that assumption — `visibilityState` stays `'visible'` on an
 *    unattended second monitor, which is exactly the case this feature is for —
 *    so a poll with no sign of a person behind it stops until there is one, and
 *    the server's idle timeout means what it says again.
 *
 * `load` is called on a timer, so it must be cheap and idempotent. Whether what
 * it does is billable is a property of the caller: `of-billing` meters MCP tool
 * calls, and the console's `GET`s are not among them.
