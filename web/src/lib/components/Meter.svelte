   * Two numbers matter and they are not the same one. `billableUsed` is what
   * counts against the bucket; `totalCalls` is every call the org made. The
   * gap between them is `watch` — a continuous long poll that would bill an
   * idle agent tens of thousands of calls a month if it were charged flat — and
   * a meter that showed only the billable figure would leave a customer unable
   * to reconcile it against what their agents actually did.
   *
   * The bar can exceed 100%. It is clamped for drawing and *not* for the
   * caption, because an org that has run over needs to see by how much.
