/**
 * The console API's wire types.
 *
 * Hand-written, and mirroring `crates/of-web/src/openapi.rs` rather than
 * generated from it. Generation would be the reflex; it is the wrong trade at
 * this size. A generator has to run in CI to be worth anything, and until
 * `of-server` binds a port there is no document to fetch — so the "generated"
 * file would in practice be a checked-in artifact nobody regenerates, which is
 * the same hand-written file with a comment claiming otherwise.
 * `GET /api/openapi.json` is the authority either way; this is a transcription
 * of it, and `npm run check` fails when a page reads a field not declared here.
 *
 * Every name is camelCase because every response body is: `of-web`'s structs
 * carry `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`.
