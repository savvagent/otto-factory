/**
 * Sending the browser through sign-in.
 *
 * The console does not sign anyone in itself. `of-web` runs an OAuth
 * authorization-code + PKCE flow against the otto platform (`/auth/login` →
 * platform → `/auth/callback`) and, when it finishes, sets the session cookie and
 * redirects back. This module only builds the URL that starts it and decides when
 * starting it again would be a loop.
 *
 * **Always a full navigation, never `goto`.** `/auth/login` is a server route
 * that answers a redirect to another origin; the client router has no such page
 * and would render a 404 in the middle of an OAuth flow. (Links to it carry
 * `data-sveltekit-reload` for the same reason.)
 *
 * **`next` is only ever a path this app produced.** The server checks it again
 * and refuses anything that is not a same-origin path, so a crafted link cannot
 * bounce a signed-in visitor somewhere else.
