 * `platformHome` refused — asks the open discovery document instead, once. The
 * last address known is remembered, so signing out does not blank a link while
 * nothing about where the platform is has changed, and need fetch nothing.
 *
 * A class rather than inline effect state so the decision can be unit-tested:
 * the layout feeds it the session's scheme-checked address and readiness from
 * an `$effect`, and reads `url()` from a `$derived`.
