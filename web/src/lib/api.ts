/**
 * The one place the console talks to `of-web`.
 *
 * Three things hold here, and each of them is a rule the server also keeps.
 *
 * **No credential is ever spent on a GET.** A single-use redemption (the tracker
 * callback's authorization code) is a `POST`: a mail scanner or link preview that
 * follows a URL loads a page and burns nothing.
 *
 * **The session is never touched by script.** It is an `HttpOnly`,
 * `__Host-`-prefixed cookie that `of-web` sets when the sign-in through the
 * otto platform finishes (`/auth/login` → `/auth/callback`), so there is no token
 * to attach and nothing to store. Requests are same-origin and the browser sends
 * it; `credentials` is left at its default for exactly that reason, and a change
 * to `'include'` would be a sign someone has moved the API to another origin,
 * where the `__Host-` prefix means the cookie could not follow anyway. Writes
 * carry the browser's own `Origin` header, which the server checks.
 *
 * **An error has a code before it has a message.** `ApiError.code` is the
 * stable branch point — `not_found`, `org_session_mismatch`, `rate_limited` —
 * and `message` is written by the server to be shown to a person. Pages branch
 * on the code and render the message; they never parse the message.
 *
 * **A dead session is handled here, once.** Any response saying the session is
 * gone (`unauthenticated`) or is for another org (`org_session_mismatch`) sends
 * the whole tab through sign-in again (`$lib/login`), so no page has to.
