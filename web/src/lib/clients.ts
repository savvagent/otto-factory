/**
 * How to point a coding agent at this server.
 *
 * A data table rather than a page full of branches, and every entry has the
 * same shape, because **no client is first-class here**. otto-factory is
 * coding-agent agnostic by constraint: Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Cursor, Codex
 * and anything else speaking MCP are equally supported, nothing depends on one
 * client's plugin or hook system, and `agentType` is never validated against a
 * list. A console that gave one of them a bespoke wizard and the rest a
 * footnote would be the first place that promise quietly broke.
 *
 * Every client gets two forms:
 *
 * - **OAuth** — the intended path. The client discovers the authorization
 *   server from `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, registers itself
 *   (RFC 7591), and sends the human here to consent. No secret is ever pasted.
 * - **Token** — the compatibility path, for a client whose OAuth support is
 *   partial. A personal access token lands in the same table as an OAuth access
 *   token with the same audience and the same scopes, so nothing downstream can
 *   tell which it received.
 *
 * `generic` exists so that a client nobody here has heard of is still a
 * first-class citizen: it is the endpoint and the two discovery documents, which
 * is all any conforming MCP client actually needs.
