   * `of-billing`'s quota error and `of-mcp`'s upgrade prompt are built as
   * `{public_url}/settings/billing` — an agent that runs out of bucket puts that
   * exact string in front of a human. It has no org segment because the meter
   * builds it from configuration, once, at startup. So this page resolves the
   * org from the session and forwards; it is a signpost for a URL the rest of
   * the system already prints.
