  /**
   * What an invitation link opens.
   *
   * Behind the sign-in guard in the root layout, deliberately. The server
   * requires a session whose address matches the one invited — otherwise a code
   * forwarded to the wrong person is a way into someone else's org — and a page
   * that redeemed on load would burn the token for whoever the browser happened
   * to be signed in as. Codes now travel through chat, which unfurls links just
   * as eagerly as a mail scanner did.
   *
   * The mismatch case (`invite_wrong_account`, `403`) gets its own message,
   * because the fix is "sign in as the invited address", which is not something
   * the generic error text can know.
