/**
 * In production the console and the API are one origin: `of-server` serves the
 * built bundle beside `/api`, `/oauth`, and `/.well-known`.
 *
 * Development has to reproduce that, not merely approximate it. The session
 * cookie carries the `__Host-` prefix, which browsers refuse to store unless
 * the cookie has `Path=/` and **no `Domain`** — so it is bound to whatever
 * origin set it and cannot be sent to a different port. A dev server that
 * pointed `fetch` at `http://localhost:8080` would never send the session, and
 * CORS could not rescue it. Proxying instead keeps every request on the Vite
 * origin, where the cookie lives.
 *
 * `secure: false` only tells the proxy not to verify an upstream TLS
 * certificate; it has nothing to do with the cookie's `Secure` attribute, which
 * browsers honour on `localhost` regardless.
