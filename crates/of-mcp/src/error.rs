//! Turning domain failures into something an agent can act on.
//!
//! The reader of every string in this file is an LLM that has never seen the
//! documentation, is holding a partly-wrong model of the server's state, and
//! must decide within one turn whether to retry, change the arguments, or give
//! up and ask a human. That audience changes what a good error is:
//!
//! - **Say what was wrong, what was valid, and what to call next.** `of-core`
//!   already writes its messages this way — `RepoUnresolved` lists the
//!   registered slugs, `LeaseHeld` names the holder and the expiry — so this
//!   module's job is to carry them through intact rather than flatten them into
//!   "bad request".
//! - **Put the branch point in machine-readable data, not in prose.** An agent
//!   matching on message text breaks the first time someone rewords one.
//!   `code` is stable; `retriable` answers the only question the agent has to
//!   resolve before its next action.
//! - **Never leak across the tenant boundary.** A message may name the caller's
//!   own repos and jobs. It may never name anything it took another org's data
//!   to know, which is why these are built from `of-core` errors that were
//!   themselves produced inside a pinned transaction.
