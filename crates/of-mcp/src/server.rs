//! The MCP service: the shared state a tool call runs against, and the shape
//! every tool has in common.
//!
//! ## Where the caller comes from
//!
//! `rmcp` creates one service instance per MCP *session*, and a session spans
//! many HTTP requests. The authenticated principal therefore cannot live on the
//! service — it belongs to the request. The transport carries each request's
//! [`http::request::Parts`] into the tool call's context, and
//! [`crate::auth::require_bearer`] has already inserted a [`Principal`] into
//! that request's extensions, so every handler starts with
//! `Extension(parts): Extension<Parts>` and calls [`Factory::caller`].
//!
//! That indirection is doing real work: it is what makes token revocation take
//! effect on the next call rather than at the end of a session that may last
//! for days.
//!
//! ## Where the tenant comes from
//!
//! From the token, and only from the token. A token's org is fixed at issuance,
//! so no tool accepts an org argument and no tool consults one from anywhere
//! else. [`Factory::tx`] opens a transaction pinned to it, which is the only
//! way `of-core` will hand out tenant data at all.
//!
//! ## What a tool body looks like
//!
//! Check the scope, open the transaction, do exactly one thing, commit. Metering
//! (milestone 1 task 9) writes its counters inside that same transaction, before
//! the commit — a failed call must not be billed, and a successful one must not
//! be billed twice, and only a shared transaction gives both.

/// What the MCP surface tells a client it is, in the client's own words.

/// Read by an LLM before it calls anything, so it is written as operating
/// guidance rather than marketing: the three things an agent gets wrong on its
/// first session are naming the repo, claiming without checking `ready`, and
/// polling instead of waiting.
const INSTRUCTIONS: &str = "\
otto-factory coordinates agentic coding work across a team. Everything here is \
anchored on repositories: a job belongs to a repo, a lease is taken on a repo's \
branch, and a tool that cannot work out which repo you mean will refuse rather \
than guess.

Getting started in a new session:
  1. Call whoami to see which organization this token opens and what you may do.
  2. Identify your repo once. Pass `remote` with the output of \
`git remote get-url origin`, or `repo` with a registered slug. If nothing \
matches, list_repos shows what is registered and register_repo adds this one.
  3. Call ready to see claimable work, claim_jobs to take it, and complete_job \
or fail_job when you are done. Never start work you have not claimed: claiming \
is what stops two agents doing the same job.

Before editing a branch, take a lease on it with acquire_lease and renew it \
while you work. Leases are advisory — the server cannot see your git \
operations — so they make collisions visible rather than impossible. \
list_leases answers 'who else is in this repo right now'.

Use watch instead of polling. It blocks until something in your organization \
changes and returns 'changed' or 'timeout'; call it again either way. Your own \
messages never wake you.

Jobs carry a free-form `metadata` object that this server never reads or \
interprets. Put whatever your own workflow needs in it.

You are billed for work performed, not for looking: reads, watch, and lease \
renewals cost nothing, while queueing, claiming, completing and messaging \
consume the plan's monthly allowance. Call usage to see where you stand.";
