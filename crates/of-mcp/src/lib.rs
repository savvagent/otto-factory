//! `of-mcp` — the Streamable HTTP MCP surface.
//!
//! This crate is the product's front door: one HTTPS endpoint that any
//! MCP-speaking coding agent can be pointed at, with OAuth 2.1 in front of it
//! (the otto platform is the authorization server) and `of-core`'s
//! tenant-pinned queue behind it.
//!
//! ```text
//!   POST /mcp
//!     └─ require_bearer ──── introspect the token at the platform, attach the principal
//!          └─ StreamableHttpService ──── rmcp session, JSON-RPC framing
//!               └─ Factory ──── one tool call
//!                    └─ Db::begin(org) ──── of-core, RLS, commit
//! ```
//!
//! ## Three decisions worth knowing before changing anything here
//!
//! **No SQL lives in this crate.** Every statement is a `of-core` method on a
//! [`otto_tenant::Tx`], which cannot be constructed without an org. A query written
//! here would bypass the pinning that tenant isolation's second guard depends
//! on, so there is no "just this once" version of it.
//!
//! **Nothing is client-specific.** No tool annotation, hook, or capability that
//! only one agent understands, no validation of `agentType` against a list of
//! known agents, no branch on the client's name. A feature that works in one
//! coding agent and not another does not ship, so the surface is plain
//! Streamable HTTP and plain JSON Schema.
//!
//! **The server ships no workflow.** These tools are primitives — queue,
//! dependencies, claims, leases, messages, change notification. How work is
//! specified, planned, reviewed, or measured belongs in the customer's own
//! skills calling these tools, which is what the opaque `metadata` field on a
//! job is for. When a proposed feature could live either here or in a caller's
//! skill, it belongs in the skill.

/// agent initiates — so a server-held session would buy nothing and cost the

/// request from one client landing on the replica that holds its session.

/// and no shared session store.
