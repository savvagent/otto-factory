//! What tools return.
//!
//! Every result is an **object with one named field**, never a bare array or a
//! bare scalar. Two reasons, and the first is not negotiable: MCP requires a
//! tool's `outputSchema` to have root type `object`, so `Json<Vec<Job>>` is not
//! a legal result. The second is that an envelope can grow — the day `list_jobs`
//! wants to return a cursor alongside the rows, `{"jobs": [...]}` gains a field
//! and every existing caller still works, where a top-level array would have to
//! break them all.
//!
//! The payloads are `of-core`'s own domain types rather than view structs
//! mirrored into this crate. A parallel set of types would need updating in two
//! places whenever a column is added, and the copy that got missed would be the
//! one agents read. `of-core` derives `JsonSchema` alongside the `Serialize` it
//! already had, which is the same concern rather than a new one.
