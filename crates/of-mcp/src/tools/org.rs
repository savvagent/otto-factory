//! Organization tools.
//!
//! `whoami` is the tool an agent should call first in a session, and it is the
//! answer to a question no other tool answers: *which* of a person's
//! organizations does this token open? A user may belong to several; a token
//! opens exactly one, fixed when it was issued and not selectable per call. An
//! agent that assumes otherwise queues work in the wrong company's queue.
//!
//! Both tools here are free, and deliberately so: a caller must never have to
//! spend an operation to find out how many it has left.
