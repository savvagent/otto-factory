//! The tool surface.
//!
//! Split by domain so each file stays readable; `rmcp`'s [`ToolRouter`] adds,
//! so the four routers are combined in [`router`].
//!
//! ## Two conventions every tool follows
//!
//! **Naming a repo.** Coordination is anchored on repos, so almost every tool
//! takes an optional `repo` (a registered slug) *or* `remote` (whatever
//! `git remote get-url origin` printed, in any spelling). The agent passes what
//! it has and the server normalizes. When neither resolves, the error lists the
//! registered slugs and points at `register_repo` — it never falls back to a
//! default, because queueing work against a repo nobody meant is a silent,
//! expensive failure and an error is a cheap one.
//!
//! **Output shape.** Every result is a one-field object — `{"job": …}`,
//! `{"jobs": […]}` — carrying `of-core`'s own domain types. See [`out`] for why
//! it is an envelope rather than the bare value, and why the payloads are not
//! mirrored into view structs.
