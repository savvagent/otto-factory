//! The OAuth resource server: what stands between a bearer token and the queue.
//!
//! `of-auth` is the authorization server — it decides who may have a token and
//! what it says. This module is the *resource* server, and it has exactly three
//! jobs, in this order:
//!
//! 1. **Refuse an unauthenticated request in a way that teaches the client how
//!    to authenticate.** A `401` carrying
//!    `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="…"` (RFC 9728) is the entire
//!    onboarding story: the user pastes one MCP URL into their agent, the agent
//!    gets this header, follows it to the metadata document, finds the
//!    authorization server, registers itself, and opens a browser. Nothing else
//!    is configured anywhere. Get this header wrong and the product's premise —
//!    one URL, no install — stops working, in a way that looks to the user like
//!    "the server is broken".
//! 2. **Enforce the audience.** [`of_auth::tokens::introspect`] refuses a token
//!    minted for any other resource. This is the confused-deputy defense and it
//!    is why the canonical URI is configuration rather than something derived
//!    from the request's `Host` header — a header an attacker controls is not a
//!    thing to compare an audience against.
//! 3. **Attach the principal to the request**, so handlers downstream have an
//!    org and a user without re-deciding authorization per tool.
//!
//! **The principal is per request, not per session.** An MCP session spans many
//! HTTP requests, and the token is re-introspected on every one. That costs an
//! indexed lookup and buys immediate revocation: a token revoked in the console
//! stops working on the agent's next call rather than whenever its session
//! happens to end.
