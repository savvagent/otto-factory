//! The console API's error envelope.
//!
//! Every failure leaves here as `{"error": {"code": …, "message": …}}` with a
//! status that matches. `code` is the stable branch point a UI switches on;
//! `message` is what it shows a human. That is the same split `of-core::Error`
//! already makes for agents, and it is deliberately the same envelope shape, so
//! a person debugging the console and a person debugging an agent are reading
//! the same thing.
//!
//! **Two rules about what goes in `message`.**
//!
//! A database error is never one of them. `of_core::Error::Db` carries table
//! and constraint names, which tell an attacker about a schema they cannot
//! otherwise see and tell a user nothing they can act on. It is logged in full
//! and reported as a flat internal error.
//!
//! The same goes for a failed call to the platform: its response text is logged,
//! and the caller is told only that the platform could not be reached.
