//! `of-web` — the console API.
//!
//! Everything a human's browser asks of otto-factory *about its own domain*:
//! repos, the queue, tracker connections, and this service's audit trail. Plus
//! two machine endpoints, both authenticated by signature rather than by token:
//! tracker webhooks (`/webhooks/{provider}`) and the otto platform's lifecycle
//! webhooks (`/platform/webhooks`).
//!
//! Identity is not here. Accounts, orgs, members, teams, SSO, tokens, and the
//! usage meter live in the otto platform, which is also the OAuth authorization
//! server for the MCP surface and for the console's own sign-in. This crate is a
//! *resource server* and an OAuth *client*: it asks the platform who a token
//! belongs to, and it holds the session a console login leaves behind. That is
//! all it knows about identity.
//!
//! ```text
//!   Browser        ──► /auth/login, /auth/callback   OAuth code + PKCE against the platform
//!   Browser        ──► /api/orgs/{org}/…   console session cookie ──┐
//!   Script         ──► /api/orgs/{org}/…   platform bearer token ───┴► OrgCtx ──► of-core
//!   Tracker        ──► /webhooks/{provider}  provider signature
//!   Platform       ──► /platform/webhooks    Otto-Signature ──► platform_events
//! ```
//!
//! The console signs in through the platform (`routes::auth`) and keeps its own
//! session: a cookie that keys a stored platform token pair (`console`). Both
//! credentials are resolved to the platform's claims by one function
//! (`session::authenticate`).
//!
//! ## What holds across the whole crate
//!
//! **No SQL.** Every statement is a `of-core` method, for the same reason as in
//! `of-mcp`: a query written here would bypass the tenant-pinned transaction
//! that isolation's second guard depends on.
//!
//! **Authorization is decided by an extractor, not by a handler.**
//! [`session::OrgCtx`] resolves the caller, the org in the path, and their role
//! before a handler body runs, and a handler that needs more than membership
//! says so in one line. A handler that forgets is a handler that serves another
//! tenant's data, and a type is a better place for that than a review checklist.
//!
//! **An org that is not the token's is `404`.** Answering `403` on a real slug
//! and `404` on a fake one turns any token into a directory of who uses the
//! product.
//!
//! **The router and the OpenAPI document come from one list.** See
//! [`catalog`] — routes and their descriptions are the same declaration, so
//! they cannot drift apart.
