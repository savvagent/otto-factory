//! The endpoint catalog — one description of the console API, used twice.
//!
//! **Why a catalog rather than annotations on each handler.** The plan asks for
//! an OpenAPI document generated from the handlers, and the failure mode it is
//! guarding against is a document that drifts from the code. A macro on each
//! handler is one way; this is another, and it makes drift impossible rather
//! than merely detectable: [`crate::router`] is *built from* this list, and
//! [`crate::openapi::document`] is *rendered from* the same list. There is no
//! second place where a route is declared, so there is nothing for a document
//! to fall out of step with.
//!
//! It also keeps the OpenAPI vocabulary out of `of-core`. The alternative —
//! deriving schema traits on the domain types — spreads a documentation
//! dependency across every crate to describe an interface only this one serves.
//!
//! The cost is honest and worth naming: request and response bodies are
//! referenced by component name rather than derived from the Rust types, so a
//! field added to a response struct does not appear in the document until
//! someone adds it to [`crate::openapi::components`]. The test at the bottom of
//! `openapi.rs` catches a *missing* component, not a stale field.
