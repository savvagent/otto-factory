//! Who is calling the console API.
//!
//! # Two credentials, one identity
//!
//! The console API accepts either of two credentials, and both end in the same
//! call: the platform introspecting a platform-issued access token.
//!
//! ```text
//!   Authorization: Bearer otto_at_…  (or otto_pat_…)   scripts, CI, agents
//!       └─ PlatformClient::introspect
//!   Cookie: __Host-of_session=…                         the console in a browser
//!       └─ the session row ── held token pair ── refreshed if expiring
//!            └─ PlatformClient::introspect              (see `crate::console`)
//!
//!            └─ active? which user, org, role, scopes?
//!                 └─ the `{org}` in the path must be the token's org
//! ```
//!
//! [`authenticate`] is the one place a credential becomes an identity.
//! **A bearer token, when present, decides the request**, valid or not: it is never
//! "fixed" by falling back to a cookie, so a script's behaviour does not depend on
//! what a browser left lying around. Only a request with no `Authorization`
//! bearer looks at the cookie. Everything downstream of [`OrgCtx`] needs to know
//! nothing about which it was, except one thing: a cookie session is bound to one
//! org, and asking it for another is not "no such org" but a prompt to sign in to
//! that one — see [`ApiError::org_session_mismatch`].
//!
//! The cookie is an ambient credential, so cookie-authenticated writes are
//! guarded against cross-site requests ([`crate::csrf`]); a bearer is not ambient
//! and is exempt.
//!
//! # What an extractor guarantees
//!
//! [`OrgCtx`] resolves the caller, the org in the path, and their role before a
//! handler body runs, and a handler that needs more than membership says so in
//! one line. A handler that forgets is a handler that serves another tenant's
//! data, and a type is a better place for that than a review checklist.
//!
//! - **An org that is not the token's is `404`.** A token opens exactly one org,
//!   fixed when it was issued. Answering `403` on a real slug and `404` on a fake
//!   one turns any token into a directory of who uses the product. (A *cookie*
//!   session asking for another org is `401 org_session_mismatch` instead: the
//!   person is signed in, just not to that org, and the console's answer is to sign
//!   in again with an `org_hint`. It leaks nothing a login would not.)
//! - **A platform outage is `503`, never `401`.** Same reasoning as the MCP
//!   surface: `401` sends a client off to sign in again against the thing that is
//!   down.
//! - **Scopes are checked as the MCP tools check them.** A token that could not
//!   `repos:write` over MCP cannot over the console.
