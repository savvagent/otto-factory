//! Tracker connections and per-repo bindings, from the console side.
//!
//! Tasks 1–5 of Milestone 2 built a sync engine that reads
//! `tracker_connections` and `tracker_bindings`. This is the only thing that
//! writes them. Nothing in the MCP surface does, on purpose: connecting a
//! tracker is an admin act performed by a human in a browser, and the agent
//! side of the product has no business holding a provider's OAuth credentials.
//!
//! **The network work happens before the transaction, not inside it.** Both
//! connect flows make two provider round trips, and holding a pinned
//! transaction open across them would keep a database connection per admin
//! sitting on a consent screen. The cost of getting this order right is that a
//! failed *write* leaves a spent authorization code behind and the admin runs
//! the flow again; the cost of getting it wrong is a connection pool held
//! hostage by GitHub's latency.
