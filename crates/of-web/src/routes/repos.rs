//! The same rows the MCP tools `register_repo` and `update_repo` write. There is
//! deliberately no second code path: both surfaces call the same `of-core`
//! functions, so a repo registered by an agent and one registered by a human in
//! the console are the same thing, resolvable by the same remotes.
//!
//! The request types here are of-web's own rather than `of_core::NewRepo`
//! deserialized directly. `NewRepo` carries `created_by`, which the *server*
//! decides from the session — a client that could set it would be able to
//! attribute its registrations to somebody else. It also carries
//! `tracker_binding`, the free-form JSON blob from Milestone 1, which the
//! console deliberately no longer writes: `tracker_bindings` rows created
//! through `routes::trackers` are what webhook ingest and the sync engine
//! actually read, and two fields describing the same thing where only one is
//! consulted is a trap rather than a convenience.
