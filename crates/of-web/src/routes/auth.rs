//! Signing up, signing in, and the passkey that is both.
//!
//! ## No email, and now no identifier either
//!
//! A passkey brings an account into existence: [`signup_start`] creates the row
//! with **no address at all**, and [`signup_finish`] turns it into an account
//! once a credential is registered against it. The address is a profile field
//! set afterwards, by someone already holding the key.
//!
//! That ordering is what finally closes the account-enumeration oracle. Removing
//! email forced signup to hand a TOTP secret back in its own response, which
//! meant refusing addresses that already had one — and that refusal was the
//! leak. Nothing is submitted to [`signup_start`] or [`login_start`], so there
//! is no question for either to answer differently. The one place the product
//! will say "that address is taken" is [`set_profile`], which needs a session.
//!
//! ## Every ceremony is two requests
//!
//! `…/start` issues a challenge and stores its state server-side; `…/finish`
//! presents the signature. The ceremony id in between is a lookup key, not a
//! credential: it is single-use, expiring, and useless without a signature the
//! matching authenticator can produce.
//!
//! ## No credential is ever spent on a `GET`
//!
//! Unchanged, and it still matters: an invitation code travels through chat,
//! and chat unfurls links.
