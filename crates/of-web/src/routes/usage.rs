//! The usage meter, read-only.
//!
//! The same numbers the `usage` MCP tool reports, from the same
//! `of_billing::Meter::report`, so the figure in the console and the figure an
//! agent sees cannot disagree.
//!
//! **Reading your own bill is free.** The meter held in [`AppState`] is
//! constructed with enforcement off and nothing here calls `charge`. Billing a
//! customer for looking at what they have been billed is the kind of detail
//! that costs more in trust than it could ever earn in revenue — and an org
//! that has run out must be able to see *why* it has run out.
