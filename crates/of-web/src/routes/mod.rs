/// Distinguish "field absent" from "field present and null".
///
/// serde collapses both into `None` for an `Option<T>`; wrapping the whole
/// deserialization in `Some` recovers the difference — absent stays `None`
/// because of `#[serde(default)]`, while an explicit `null` arrives as
/// `Some(None)`.
///
/// A repo's `teamId` needs the distinction and cannot fake it: it has to be
/// un-settable, or a team-scoped repo can never be made org-wide (which is also
/// how an admin releases a repo whose team the platform has deleted).
