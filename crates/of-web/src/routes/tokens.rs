//! Personal access tokens — the compatibility path for clients whose OAuth
//! support is partial or absent.
//!
//! A PAT is not a weaker credential. It lands in the same table as an OAuth
//! access token, carries the same audience, the same scope model, and the same
//! per-request introspection, so nothing downstream can tell which kind it
//! received. That equivalence is the point: agent-agnosticism must not mean a
//! weaker security model for the awkward clients, or the awkward clients become
//! the way in.
//!
//! Three rules hold here.
//!
//! **A token is shown exactly once.** Only the SHA-256 hash is stored, so there
//! is no second chance by construction — the console has to make the user copy
//! it now.
//!
//! **You mint your own.** An admin cannot mint a token for another member. A
//! credential that acts as someone else, created by someone else, makes the
//! audit trail a work of fiction; an admin who needs an agent running in the
//! org can mint one as themselves.
//!
//! **Scopes cannot exceed what the console grants.** The request names scopes
//! and they are validated against the same list the authorization server uses,
//! so a PAT can never carry a scope an OAuth token could not.
