//! The queue, read-only.
//!
//! The console watches the queue; it does not drive it. Every write — enqueue,
//! claim, complete, fail, repend — belongs to the MCP surface, because the
//! agent doing the work is the only party that knows when the work is done.
//! Putting a "mark complete" button here would put a human in a position to lie
//! to the queue about state they cannot observe.
//!
//! So this module is three `GET`s: the list, one job, and the counters behind
//! the overview page. They exist because "why is my agent waiting?" is a
//! question a person asks in a browser, and answering it by telling them to
//! attach an MCP client is not an answer.
//!
//! **Filters name slugs, not ids.** A console URL carries `?repo=api-gateway`,
//! not a UUID, for the same reason repo and team routes take slugs: a slug is
//! what a person types and what a link can be shared as. An unregistered slug
//! is an error listing what *is* registered — `resolve_repo` and `resolve_team`
//! already write that message, and a filter that silently matched nothing would
//! render an empty queue that looks like a quiet one.
