//! The otto platform's lifecycle webhooks.
//!
//! The platform owns orgs, teams, and memberships and tells every registered
//! resource server when it deletes one (`org.deleted`, `team.deleted`,
//! `member.removed`). This is the receiving end: verify the signature, then hand
//! the event to `of_core::platform_events`, which does the (idempotent) clean-up.
//!
//! Mounted at `/platform/webhooks`, not under `/webhooks/{provider}`: that path
//! belongs to tracker deliveries and resolves its `{provider}` segment against
//! GitHub and JIRA only. A separate prefix means a platform event can never be
//! mistaken for a tracker one, and the two secrets can never be confused.
//!
//! **The status code is the retry protocol.** The platform redelivers anything
//! that is not a 2xx, with backoff, until its budget runs out. So:
//!
//! - a bad or missing signature is `401` and is never processed (the body is not
//!   even parsed before the MAC checks out);
//! - a handled event, a repeat, and an event type this version does not know are
//!   all `200`: retrying them would change nothing;
//! - a failure to apply (a database error) is `5xx`, so the platform tries again.
