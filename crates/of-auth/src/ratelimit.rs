//! Attempt throttling with exponential lockout.
//!
//! A passkey ceremony is cryptographic, not a guessable secret, but the login
//! endpoint that resolves it is still a network-reachable surface: without
//! throttling nothing stops a flood of forged or replayed authentication
//! attempts, or spamming a passkey-reset/claim flow. This is not an optional
//! hardening pass — it is what keeps the surface safe under abuse.
//!
//! Buckets are opaque strings so one table serves per-user, per-email, and
//! per-IP limits. **Always throttle on both an identity key and the source IP**:
//! identity-only lets one attacker spray a million addresses, IP-only lets a
//! botnet through.
