//! `of-auth` — authentication and authorization.
//!
//! Two layers that must not be conflated:
//!
//! - **Layer 2, who the human is**: [`login`] is the front door, over
//!   [`passkeys`] (WebAuthn, usernameless, phishing-resistant) and
//!   [`sessions`] (the console's browser cookie). Enterprise OIDC
//!   federation joins this layer later.
//!
//!   **No email, anywhere.** There is no verification link, no recovery link,
//!   and no mailer — a passkey is the only factor, a second passkey is the
//!   only self-service way back in, and an org admin resetting a member's
//!   passkeys (`of_web::routes::orgs::reset_member_passkeys`) is the only
//!   assisted one. That is a product decision with a consequence worth
//!   stating plainly: signup takes no request body at all, so there is
//!   nothing submitted before a ceremony to answer differently about — the
//!   account-enumeration oracle a password or a returned secret used to leak
//!   through is closed by construction. See `of_web::routes::auth`.
//! - **Layer 1, what a client may do**: the OAuth 2.1 authorization server and
//!   the token model.
//!
//! We implement published standards rather than anything bespoke — OAuth 2.1
//! (authorization code + PKCE S256 only), RFC 8414 AS metadata, RFC 9728
//! protected-resource metadata, RFC 7591 dynamic client registration, RFC 8707
//! resource indicators, RFC 7009 revocation. A non-standard server would not
//! merely fail an enterprise security review; MCP clients would be unable to
//! connect to it at all.
//!
//! No password is ever accepted, stored, or reset, and no cryptographic
//! primitive is hand-written — see [`crypto`] for what is used where.
