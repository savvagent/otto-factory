//! Charging a tool call against an org's bucket.
//!
//! ## Why this happens *before* the work rather than after
//!
//! [`Meter::charge`] is called immediately after the tool opens its
//! transaction, before it does anything. That looks wrong for the rule "a
//! failed call is not billed" — and it is exactly what makes the rule true.
//! The usage row is written inside the tool's own transaction, so a tool that
//! fails and returns an error rolls the transaction back and takes the meter
//! with it. Charging afterwards would need a second transaction, which can fail
//! on its own, be retried, or be forgotten — all three of which produce a bill
//! that disagrees with what happened.
//!
//! Doing it first also puts the quota check where a refusal costs nothing: the
//! caller is told no before any work is performed, rather than after.
//!
//! ## What enforcement means
//!
//! Enforcement is off by default and behind a flag for milestone 1, because
//! recording history is worth having long before anyone's work is refused over
//! it. When it is on, only **billable** tools on a **hard-stop** plan are
//! refused, and only past the bucket. Reads keep working in every case, so an
//! org that hits its limit mid-task can still see the state of its queue,
//! finish reasoning about it, and go and upgrade — rather than being locked out
//! of its own data by a counter.
