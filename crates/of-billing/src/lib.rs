//! `of-billing` — metering, buckets, and the free/billable split.
//!
//! The billable unit is the MCP tool call, but **not every call is billable**,
//! and that classification ([`classify`]) is load-bearing rather than a detail:
//! `watch` is a continuous long poll, and billing it flat would charge an idle
//! agent tens of thousands of operations a month for waiting quietly, which is
//! precisely the behaviour the server asks of it.
//!
//! The split of responsibility with the platform is deliberate. The platform
//! owns plans, standing, and the monthly totals; this crate owns policy — which
//! tools cost anything ([`classify`]), when a call is refused ([`meter`]) — and
//! the *record* of every call, kept in the factory's own database as a
//! transactional outbox ([`outbox`]) that a background task ships to the
//! platform. That leaves the interesting decisions unit-testable with no
//! database at all, which is why the threshold arithmetic in [`meter`] and the
//! price list in [`classify`] have tests that run in microseconds.
//!
//! The one thing that must not be refactored apart: the outbox row is written
//! **in the same transaction as the tool's own work**. A failed call is not
//! billed and a successful one is never lost, and both of those follow from that
//! single fact rather than from any retry logic.
