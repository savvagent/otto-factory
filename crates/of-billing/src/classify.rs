//! **Not every call is billable, and this is a product decision before it is a
//! technical one.** `watch` is a thirty-second long poll that every connected
//! agent calls continuously. Billing it flat would charge an idle agent roughly
//! 86,000 operations a month for doing nothing, which makes a bill impossible
//! to predict and punishes the very behaviour the server asks for — waiting
//! instead of polling.
//!
//! The rule stated to customers is: **you pay for work performed, not for
//! looking.** Every classification below has to be defensible against that
//! sentence, so each one that is not obvious carries its reason.
//!
//! Both classes are recorded regardless. Repricing later needs history to
//! reprice against, and a call that was never written down cannot be
//! reconsidered.
