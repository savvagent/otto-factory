//! Change notification: one `LISTEN` for the whole server, fanned out in process.
//!
//! Agents need to react to queue changes without polling, and `watch` is the
//! long-poll tool that lets them. The naive implementation — a Postgres channel
//! per org — does not survive multi-tenancy: channel names are identifiers, so
//! per-org channels mean a `LISTEN` per tenant on every connection, and the
//! `LISTEN` set has to be rewritten every time an org is created.
//!
//! Instead one connection listens on `df_changes`, every payload carries its
//! `org`, and this module dispatches to the waiters for that org. A payload for
//! an org with nobody waiting is dropped, which is the common case and costs
//! nothing.
