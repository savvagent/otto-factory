//! The scopes otto-factory's resource server understands.
//!
//! Scope strings are only meaningful within one resource server. The otto
//! platform (the authorization server) validates every authorize, code
//! redemption, refresh, and PAT against the scope list registered for this
//! resource, and this service checks them again in every tool. The registration
//! is an operator step (`otto-platform-server resource register --scopes …`,
//! see docs/deploy/fly.md); this module is the single place otto-factory says
//! what it understands, so the registration, the advertised metadata
//! (`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`), and the tools' own scope checks
//! cannot drift apart. The `scopes_supported` document is generated from
//! [`KNOWN`].
//!
//! An unknown scope is rejected rather than ignored — silently dropping a
//! requested scope gives a client a token that does less than it believes,
//! which fails later and confusingly.
