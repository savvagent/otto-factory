//! Repo leases — the primitive that stops two agents colliding on one resource.
//!
//! A lease is **advisory and time-bounded**. otto-factory cannot see what an
//! agent actually does with a leased resource — a git operation, a migration
//! run, a deploy — so it cannot prevent a determined agent from working on one
//! anyway; what it can do is make the collision visible before it happens and
//! give a well-behaved agent somewhere else to go. That limitation is deliberate
//! and is documented to customers rather than hidden — a lease is a coordination
//! signal, not a mutex.
//!
//! Time-bounded matters just as much: an agent that crashes mid-job must not
//! wedge a repository forever. Leases expire, and any acquire reaps the expired
//! ones first.
