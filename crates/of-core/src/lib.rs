//! `of-core` — the otto-factory domain: orgs, repos, jobs, leases, messages.
//!
//! This crate owns every SQL statement in the product and knows nothing about
//! HTTP, MCP, or authentication. Two rules hold throughout, and both exist to
//! make cross-tenant leakage structurally impossible rather than merely unlikely:
//!
//! 1. **Every tenant-scoped operation takes an [`OrgId`]** — usually by being a
//!    method on [`Tx`], which cannot be constructed without one. There is no
//!    function in this crate that reads a job without naming an org.
//! 2. **Every tenant transaction runs pinned.** [`Db::begin`] issues
//!    `SET LOCAL ROLE of_app` and `SET LOCAL app.org_id`, so Postgres row-level
//!    security applies even when the connecting user owns the tables. A query
//!    that forgets its `org_id` predicate returns nothing instead of leaking.
//!    Where `of_app` cannot exist — managed Postgres does not hand out the
//!    cluster privilege to create it — `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` carries the
//!    same guarantee, and [`Db::verify_tenant_isolation`] proves at startup that
//!    one of the two is genuinely in force. See [`isolation`].
