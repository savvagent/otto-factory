//! Domain errors.
//!
//! These are written to be readable by an LLM tool caller that has never seen
//! the docs: a failure says what went wrong, what the valid options were, and
//! what to call next. `NotFound` naming the org, `UnknownRepo` listing the
//! registered slugs, and `LeaseHeld` naming the holder all exist for that
//! reason — a bare "not found" makes an agent guess, and a guessing agent
//! retries wrongly.
