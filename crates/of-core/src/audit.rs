//! Audit actions that belong to the factory's own domain.
//!
//! The audit trail itself — `Entry`, `Db::audit`, `Tx::audit`, and the identity
//! and auth action names — is `otto_tenant::audit`. An action is a plain string,
//! so a service adds its own without touching the platform; these are the ones
//! otto-factory writes. Import this module's `action` alongside
//! `otto_tenant::audit::action` under another name where both are needed.
