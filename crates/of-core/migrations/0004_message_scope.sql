-- A message keeps the team scope it was sent under (savvagent/otto-factory#192).
--
-- Who may read a message is decided by its team, its repo's team, and its job's
-- (and that job's repo's) team. The repo and job links are `ON DELETE SET NULL`,
-- so a message only ever *looked* scoped while they lasted: deleting a team's
-- repo turned its messages org-wide, readable by every member. `scope_teams` is
-- the set of every team the message was bound to when it was sent, including
-- the thread it replies to, and it never changes. A reader must be on all of
-- them, whatever has been deleted since. (The live repo and job checks still
-- apply as well, so a repo moved to another team after the fact also hides its
-- messages; the snapshot only ever narrows.)
--
-- The job link also never worked as written: `FOREIGN KEY (org_id, job_id) ...
-- ON DELETE SET NULL` nulls *both* columns, `org_id` is NOT NULL, and so
-- deleting any job that had a message failed outright. Postgres 15's column
-- list nulls only `job_id`.

-- Backfill existing rows from what is still linked. Per org, with both the
-- explicit predicate and `app.org_id` (see CLAUDE.md). Where the migrating role
-- is subject to row-level security, the org loop itself finds no rows and this
-- does nothing. That is not a hole: the live checks still apply, and
-- `delete_job` folds a job's teams into its messages' `scope_teams` before it
-- unlinks them, so this backfill is never what keeps a message scoped.
