# Milestone 2 — of-trackers: GitHub App + JIRA two-way sync

**Spec:** [`docs/specs/2026-09-03-of-trackers-design.md`](../specs/2026-09-03-of-trackers-design.md)
— read it first. This plan implements it exactly.

Goal: turn `of-trackers` from a one-line stub into the two-way sync engine the design of
record describes — GitHub App + JIRA connections bound per org, tracker bindings per repo,
inbound webhook ingest that creates/updates jobs, outbound job-transition writeback, and
the `link_ticket`/`sync_ticket` MCP tools — while keeping every existing invariant
(tenant isolation's two guards, SQL confined to `of-core`, metering classification,
no AI attribution, forward-only migrations) intact.

## Status — 2026-09-03

Task 1 ✅ shipped (PR #18). Task 2 ✅ shipped (PR #20). Task 3 ✅ shipped (PR #22).
Task 4 ✅ shipped (PR #24). Task 5 ✅ shipped (PR #26). Task 6 ✅ shipped — expanded into
five sub-tasks under [`docs/plans/2026-09-04-tracker-console.md`](2026-09-04-tracker-console.md),
because the four checkboxes below assumed console REST routes that did not exist.

## Global Constraints

- Every SQL statement lives in `of-core`. No query in `of-trackers`, `of-web`, or `of-mcp`.
- Every tenant-scoped function takes an explicit `OrgId` and threads it through `Tx`
  (Guard 1); every new tenant table gets a `<table>_tenant_isolation` FORCE RLS policy
  discovered by `Db::verify_tenant_isolation`'s naming convention (Guard 2), plus a
  cross-org negative test. Without the negative test the task is not done.
- Migrations are forward-only, one file per concern, in `crates/of-core/migrations/`.
  Never edit an applied migration — add a new one.
- Run `cargo fmt --all` before every Rust commit. No `unwrap()` outside tests. No AI
  self-attribution anywhere (commits, PR bodies, comments, docs).
- Coordination stays anchored on repos: a tracker binding always names a `repo_id`, never
  a standalone tracker entity with no repo. Any `OF_*` config this milestone adds
  (`OF_GITHUB_APP_ID`, `OF_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, `OF_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, later)
  must fail `Config::from_env` loudly on an unparseable value, never default silently.
- No credential is ever spent on a `GET` — the webhook route (Task 3) and any console
  binding action (Task 6) that consumes a one-time code must be a `POST`.
- Tests need `podman compose up -d` and a `.env` with `DATABASE_URL`
  (`cp .env.example .env`). `#[sqlx::test]` gives each test a fresh throwaway database;
  there are no database mocks.
- Any new MCP tool must be classified in `of-billing::classify` in the same task that adds
  it — `every_tool_has_a_price` fails otherwise.
- `of-mcp` tools: the org comes from the token, never a tool argument; results are a
  one-field object in `tools::out`; descriptions are written for an LLM caller with no docs.
- A breaking change to a public interface (MCP tool surface, console API, config surface,
  schema) must be named explicitly and flagged to the architect reviewer. None is planned
  in this file; if a task discovers it needs one, stop and update this plan and the spec
  first.

## File Structure

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Create.** `crates/of-core/migrations/0011_trackers.sql` | `tracker_connections`, `tracker_bindings`, RLS policies |

## Task Order & Rationale

Task 1 (schema + crypto) has no consumer and is reviewable/mergeable in total isolation —
it changes no running behavior. Tasks 2–3 (GitHub/JIRA clients, webhook route) each need
Task 1's schema to store what they mint. Task 4 (sync engine) needs 1–3. Task 5 (MCP
tools) needs the sync engine to have something to call and needs billing classified in the
same task per the Global Constraints. Task 6 (console UI) is last because it is the only
task with no test-suite gate beyond `npm run check`/`npm run lint`/`npm test`, and it reads
whatever the server-side tasks exposed.

---

## Task 1 — Schema foundation: `tracker_connections`, `tracker_bindings`, promoted crypto ✅ (PR #18)

**Files:** `crates/of-core/migrations/0011_trackers.sql`, `crates/of-core/src/crypto.rs`,
`crates/of-core/src/trackers.rs`, `crates/of-core/src/error.rs`, `crates/of-core/src/lib.rs`,
`crates/of-core/Cargo.toml`, `crates/of-core/tests/isolation.rs`,
`crates/of-core/tests/trackers.rs`, `crates/of-auth/src/crypto.rs`,
`crates/of-auth/Cargo.toml`, `crates/of-server/src/main.rs`, `crates/of-server/src/lib.rs`,
`crates/of-web/src/state.rs`, `crates/of-web/src/lib.rs`, `crates/of-web/tests/common/mod.rs`.

**Interfaces:** produces `of_core::trackers::{Provider, TrackerConnection, TrackerBinding,
upsert_connection, get_connection, delete_connection, upsert_binding, get_binding,
delete_binding, resolve_binding}` and `of_core::crypto::{Cipher, Sealed}` for later tasks
to consume. Consumes nothing new (no dependency edges added).

- [ ] Add `aes-gcm`, `rand`, `subtle`, `base64` to `crates/of-core/Cargo.toml` (all already
      workspace dependencies used by `of-auth`; just add the `of-core` `[dependencies]`
      entries).
- [ ] Move `Cipher`/`Sealed` (and their unit tests, unchanged) from
      `crates/of-auth/src/crypto.rs` to a new `crates/of-core/src/crypto.rs`. Add
      `pub mod crypto;` to `crates/of-core/src/lib.rs`.
- [ ] Add `Error::Config(String)` and `Error::Crypto(String)` to `crates/of-core/src/error.rs`
      (match the exact wording the moved tests assert: "OF_ENCRYPTION_KEY is not valid
      base64", "OF_ENCRYPTION_KEY must decode to 32 bytes, got {n}", "failed to seal
      secret", "stored nonce has the wrong length", "failed to open secret — wrong key or
      tampered ciphertext").
- [ ] Delete `Cipher`/`Sealed` and their tests from `crates/of-auth/src/crypto.rs`; keep
      `generate`, `hash`, `verify`, `prefix::*` (these are what `of-web/src/routes/auth.rs`
      and `of-web/src/routes/orgs.rs` actually call — confirmed unaffected).
- [ ] Update every `of_auth::crypto::Cipher` reference to `of_core::crypto::Cipher`:
      `crates/of-server/src/main.rs`, `crates/of-server/src/lib.rs`,
      `crates/of-web/src/state.rs` (`use of_auth::crypto::Cipher` → `use of_core::crypto::Cipher`),
      `crates/of-web/src/lib.rs`, `crates/of-web/tests/common/mod.rs`.
- [ ] Run `cargo build --workspace` and `cargo test -p of-auth` — confirm the move compiles
      clean and every remaining `of-auth` test (the ones exercising `generate`/`hash`/
      `verify`/`prefix`) still passes. This proves the move is behavior-neutral before
      any new tracker code is written.
- [ ] Write a failing test first in a new `crates/of-core/tests/trackers.rs` (mirrors the
      `#[sqlx::test]` shape in `crates/of-core/tests/queue.rs` and the shared setup in
      `crates/of-core/tests/common/mod.rs` — there is no `tests/repos.rs`; `queue.rs` is
      the closest existing example of per-org CRUD + cross-org assertions in this crate).
      Cover: upsert/get/delete on both tables, the `ON CONFLICT (org_id, provider) DO
      UPDATE` replace-on-rebind behavior, and `connection_id` becoming `NULL` when a
      connection is deleted out from under a binding. Run it — confirm it fails to compile
      (the module and migration do not exist yet).
- [ ] Write `crates/of-core/migrations/0011_trackers.sql`: `tracker_provider` enum
      (`github`, `jira`), `tracker_connections` (`org_id NOT NULL`, `provider`,
      `external_id`, nullable `encrypted_credentials`, nullable `encrypted_webhook_secret`,
      `UNIQUE (org_id, provider)`), `tracker_bindings` (`org_id NOT NULL`, `repo_id`,
      `connection_id` nullable `ON DELETE SET NULL`, `provider`, `external_ref`,
      `UNIQUE (repo_id, provider)`), indexes on `org_id` and `connection_id` for bindings.
      Exact column list and comments per spec §1. In the same migration, add a `DO $$ …
      $$` block exactly matching `0007_rls.sql`'s existing loop shape (confirmed):
      `ALTER TABLE <t> ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, `ALTER TABLE <t> FORCE ROW LEVEL
      SECURITY`, then
      `CREATE POLICY <t>_tenant_isolation ON <t> USING (org_id = current_org()) WITH CHECK (org_id = current_org())`
      for `tracker_connections` and `tracker_bindings` — reusing the `current_org()`
      function `0007_rls.sql` already defined; do not redefine it.
- [ ] Write `crates/of-core/src/trackers.rs`: `Provider` enum (`sqlx::Type` →
      `tracker_provider`), `TrackerConnection`/`TrackerBinding` structs
      (`FromRow`/`Serialize`/`JsonSchema`, matching `repos.rs`'s derive list), private
      `encode_sealed`/`decode_sealed` helpers implementing the canonical
      `base64(nonce || ciphertext)` encoding from spec §4, and CRUD functions
      (`upsert_connection`, `get_connection`, `delete_connection`, `upsert_binding`,
      `get_binding`, `delete_binding`, `resolve_binding`) each taking `&mut Tx` and an
      explicit `org_id` bind on every statement. Add `pub mod trackers;` to
      `crates/of-core/src/lib.rs`. Run `crates/of-core/tests/trackers.rs` again — confirm
      it now compiles and passes (migrations auto-apply against the throwaway
      `#[sqlx::test]` database; no manual migration step needed for this check).
- [ ] Write a failing cross-org negative test in `crates/of-core/tests/isolation.rs` for
      `tracker_connections` and `tracker_bindings`, following the file's existing pattern
      for another tenant table: create a row under org A inside a normal `Tx`, then open a
      second transaction with `SET LOCAL ROLE of_app; SET LOCAL app.org_id = '<org B>'`
      and issue an unscoped `SELECT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` against the same table, asserting
      zero rows visible/mutable. Temporarily comment out the two new `CREATE POLICY`
      statements in `0011_trackers.sql` and confirm the new test fails (proving it isn't a
      false positive), then restore the policies and confirm it passes.
- [ ] Confirm the production migration path once: `cp .env.example .env` if not already
      present, `podman compose up -d`, then `cargo run -p of-server` briefly and check the
      logs for `db.migrate().await` (the exact call in `crates/of-server/src/main.rs`)
      completing without error — this is the only place migrations run outside the test
      harness. `Ctrl-C` once it logs a successful bind.
- [ ] `cargo test -p of-core --test isolation`, `cargo test -p of-core --test trackers`,
      `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
      `cargo fmt --all --check`. All green before commit.
- [ ] `cargo fmt --all` (writes formatting), then commit: `of-core: tracker_connections, tracker_bindings, and the promoted crypto primitive`.

## Task 2 — GitHub App + JIRA OAuth clients ✅ (PR #20)

**Remaining (deferred to the sync-engine task, since `of-trackers` performs no SQL):**
persisting a rotated JIRA refresh token back into `tracker_connections.encrypted_credentials`,
and bridging `TrackerConnection.external_id: String` to `GithubAppClient`'s
`installation_id: i64`. PR #20 shipped the client-side halves of both (`OAuthTokens`
returns the rotated pair and exposes `seal_refresh_token`/`open_refresh_token`; the GitHub
client takes a typed `i64`) — the write-back and the parse-and-fail-loudly bridge belong to
whichever task first constructs a `Tx` around a live call (Task 4 or 5).

**Files:** `crates/of-trackers/src/github.rs`, `crates/of-trackers/src/jira.rs`,
`crates/of-trackers/src/lib.rs`, `crates/of-trackers/Cargo.toml` (add `jsonwebtoken` for
GitHub App JWT signing if not already present — check first), `crates/of-server` config
(`OF_GITHUB_APP_ID`, `OF_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, `OF_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — new env
vars, additive, documented in `.env.example` with the *why*).

- [x] GitHub: mint a JWT from the App id + private key (RS256, 10-minute expiry per
      GitHub's own requirement), exchange it for a short-lived installation access token
      per `external_id` (the installation id stored in `tracker_connections`), cache
      in-memory with the token's own expiry (installation tokens are ~1 hour).
- [x] GitHub: issue/comment API calls (`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n}/comments`,
      label read, issue state PATCH) using the minted token.
- [x] JIRA: authorization-code exchange for a refresh token pair, encrypted via
      `of_core::crypto::Cipher` into `tracker_connections.encrypted_credentials`;
      refresh-token rotation on expiry, writing the new sealed value back. *(The
      exchange, rotation, and seal/open helpers shipped in PR #20; the actual write-back
      into `tracker_connections` needs a `Tx`, which `of-trackers` cannot construct — see
      Remaining above.)*
- [x] JIRA: issue API calls (comment, transition) using the site id (`external_id`) and
      the rotating access token.
- [x] Recorded-fixture tests (no live network) for both clients, per the design doc's own
      testing guidance for `of-trackers`.
- [x] `cargo test -p of-trackers`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --all`.
- [x] Commit.

## Task 3 — Webhook ingest ✅ (PR #22)

**Spec:** see §5a ("Webhook org resolution") in `docs/specs/2026-09-03-of-trackers-design.md`
— read it first. It resolves a real gap the earlier checklist glossed over: every
`of-core::trackers` accessor takes a `Tx` pinned to an already-known `OrgId`, but a webhook
arrives with only a provider-native id (GitHub installation id / JIRA site id) — the org
is exactly what's being looked up, so the normal RLS-scoped path cannot answer it (an
unscoped query against `tracker_connections`, which is `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, returns
zero rows with no `app.org_id` set). §5a adds a narrow, secret-free reverse-index table
(`tracker_connection_index`, deliberately outside RLS, mirroring `access_tokens`'s
bootstrap exemption) and one new unscoped resolver function,
`of_core::trackers::resolve_connection_org`, that the webhook route calls once per request
before opening a normal `Tx` for everything else.

**Files:** `crates/of-core/migrations/0012_tracker_connection_index.sql` (new, additive),
`crates/of-core/src/trackers.rs` (add `tracker_connection_index` maintenance to
`upsert_connection`/`delete_connection`, add `resolve_connection_org`),
`crates/of-trackers/src/webhook.rs` (new — signature verification + event parsing),
a new route added to `of-web`'s `catalog.rs` (`/webhooks/{provider}`, unauthenticated by
design — verified by signature instead of a session/token) plus its handler module.

- [ ] Migration: add `tracker_connection_index` (provider, external_id, org_id,
      connection_id — PK `(provider, external_id)`), no RLS enabled, never added to any
      `tenant_tables` array. Confirm a fresh cluster applies cleanly
      (`podman compose down -v && podman compose up -d`, `cargo test -p of-core`).
- [ ] `of-core::trackers::upsert_connection` additionally upserts the matching
      `tracker_connection_index` row in the same `Tx`; `delete_connection` additionally
      deletes it. Both stay atomic with the real write — no separate transaction.
- [ ] `of-core::trackers::resolve_connection_org(db: &Db, provider, external_id) ->
      Result<Option<OrgId>>` — deliberately takes `&Db`, not `&mut Tx`, and reads only
      `tracker_connection_index`. Doc-comment states it is the one place a tracker table is
      read without an org already pinned, and that a second such accessor must not be added.
- [ ] Cross-org test (not an `rls_scopes_*`-style unscoped-SQL test — there is no policy to
      probe, by design): upsert connections for two different orgs, assert
      `resolve_connection_org` returns each org's own id and never the other's. Comment the
      test explaining why this isn't an RLS test, so a future reader doesn't mistake the
      absence of one for an oversight.
- [ ] GitHub: HMAC-SHA256 verification of `X-Hub-Signature-256` against
      `OF_GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, constant-time compare.
- [ ] JIRA: shared-secret verification per Automation webhook's configured header/query
      parameter (finalize exact mechanism against JIRA's current docs at implementation
      time — the spec left this as a Task-3 decision).
- [ ] Parse `issues`/`issue_comment` (GitHub) and Automation payloads (JIRA) into a
      provider-neutral event type `of-trackers` exposes.
- [ ] Webhook route: verify signature → parse event → extract provider id (installation id
      / site id) → `resolve_connection_org` → open a `Tx` for that `OrgId` → `get_connection`
      / `resolve_binding` for everything else. An id that resolves to no org is a `404`-shaped
      response with no detail (never confirm/deny which ids are registered to an attacker
      probing the endpoint), logged for operator visibility.
- [ ] `catalog.rs` entry with summary/description; confirm route is reachable and add to
      `the_whole_router_assembles`-style startup coverage if `of-server` needs updating.
- [ ] Recorded-fixture tests for signature verification (valid, tampered, replayed) and
      event parsing.
- [ ] `cargo test -p of-core`, `cargo test -p of-trackers`, `cargo test -p of-web`, clippy, fmt.
- [ ] Commit.

## Task 4 — Two-way sync engine ✅ (PR #24)

**Spec:** see §6 ("Two-way sync engine") in `docs/specs/2026-09-03-of-trackers-design.md`
— read it first. It resolves the design decisions this checklist originally deferred:
the trigger label (a new per-binding `tracker_bindings.trigger_label` column, defaulted
to `otto-factory`, not hardcoded), the loop-safety mechanism (`jobs.remote_revision`, an
RFC 3339 UTC string, parsed and compared as timestamps, not raw strings), how inbound job
creation/update/close resolves against existing jobs (via a new repo/tracker-scoped
`ticket_ref` lookup, no new resolution table), and where the outbound write-back — which
runs **after** the job's own `Tx` commits, not inside it — and Task 2's two deferred items
(JIRA refresh-token persistence, GitHub `installation_id` bridging) get wired in. A spec
critique round already caught and corrected: a same-`Tx` outbound design that would have
held a Postgres transaction open across an external HTTP call; a hardcoded trigger label;
a nonexistent `binding_for_repo` (the existing `resolve_binding` is what's used); an
org-wide-only `get_job_by_ticket` that would cross-contaminate repos; a GitHub ticket_ref
format (`"42"`) that didn't match the `"acme/api#42"` convention `add_job` already
documents; and a `complete_job`/`fail_job` precondition (`InProgress`-only) that cannot
fire for a ticket closed before any agent claimed the job. Read §6 in full before touching
any file below — it is long because each of those corrections is explained in place.

**Files:** `crates/of-core/migrations/0013_jobs_remote_revision.sql` (new, additive:
`jobs.remote_revision TEXT NULL`) and `crates/of-core/migrations/0014_trigger_label.sql`
(new, additive: `tracker_bindings.trigger_label TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'otto-factory'`) —
two migrations, not one, since they touch two different tables and are two different
concerns per this repo's "one file per concern" convention; `crates/of-core/src/jobs.rs`
(add `remote_revision` field, `create_from_ticket`, `get_job_by_ticket_for_repo`,
`close_from_ticket`); `crates/of-core/src/trackers.rs` (add `trigger_label` field to
`TrackerBinding`, thread it through `upsert_binding`); `crates/of-trackers/src/webhook.rs`
(extend `IssueSnapshot` with `updated_at` and `state_reason`, extend
`parse_github`/`parse_jira` to populate them); `crates/of-trackers/src/jira.rs` (add
`list_transitions`/`transition_issue`); `crates/of-trackers/src/sync.rs` (new — pure
inbound-mapping and outbound-mapping logic, no SQL/HTTP); `crates/of-web/src/routes/
webhooks.rs` (call the inbound half inside the existing per-request `Tx`);
`crates/of-mcp/src/tools/jobs.rs` (call the outbound half after `claim_jobs`/
`complete_job`/`fail_job`'s existing `Tx` commits).

- [ ] `jobs.remote_revision TEXT NULL` migration; confirm additive (no version bump,
      no breaking-change writeup, no new RLS policy needed — `jobs` is already governed
      by an existing tenant-isolation policy over the whole row).
- [ ] `tracker_bindings.trigger_label TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'otto-factory'` migration
      (separate file); add the field to `TrackerBinding` and thread it through
      `upsert_binding`'s existing column list.
- [ ] `IssueSnapshot` gains `updated_at: Option<String>` and `state_reason: Option<String>`
      (GitHub only for the latter); update both GitHub payload structs and the JIRA
      payload struct in `webhook.rs`, and the existing fixture tests' assertions.
- [ ] `of-core::jobs::get_job_by_ticket_for_repo(tx, repo_id, tracker, ticket_ref) ->
      Result<Option<Job>>` — `WHERE org_id = $1 AND repo_id = $2 AND tracker = $3 AND
      ticket_ref = $4 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1`, matching the existing
      `get_job_by_ticket`'s newest-wins tolerance but properly scoped.
- [ ] `of-core::jobs::create_from_ticket` (title/description/ticket_ref/tracker/
      remote_revision in one insert, thin wrapper over the existing `NewJob` insert path)
      and a `remote_revision`(+ title/description)-only update path, both taking `&mut Tx`
      with an explicit `org_id` bind, matching every other `of-core::jobs` function.
- [ ] `of-core::jobs::close_from_ticket(tx, id, to: Status, result: Option<&str>, error:
      Option<&str>) -> Result<Job>` — allows `Pending` *or* `InProgress` → `Completed`/
      `Failed`, used only by the sync engine; `complete_job`/`fail_job`'s existing
      `InProgress`-only precondition is unchanged for every other caller.
- [ ] `crates/of-trackers/src/jira.rs`: `list_transitions(issue_key) ->
      Vec<Transition>` (each carrying its target status name and category) and
      `transition_issue(issue_key, transition_id)`, recorded-fixture tested like the
      rest of the client.
- [ ] Inbound: a failing test first in `crates/of-trackers/tests/` for the pure mapping
      function — label-on-event-but-not-matching-binding's-`trigger_label` → dropped;
      matching label, no existing job → create; matching label, existing non-terminal job
      → update; GitHub closed + `state_reason` → complete vs fail; JIRA closed-vocabulary
      state → complete vs fail; unrecognized JIRA "closed-looking" state → left as-is, not
      guessed; revision `<=` stored (RFC 3339 parsed) → dropped; unparseable/missing
      revision on either side → applied, stored revision left unchanged. Then implement
      `of-trackers::sync`'s inbound half against it.
- [ ] Wire the inbound half into `of-web`'s webhook route: after the existing
      `resolve_connection_org` → `Tx` → `get_connection` sequence, resolve the binding via
      `find_binding_by_external_ref`, call the sync engine, write `remote_revision` in the
      same `Tx`. No binding, `connection_id IS NULL`, or label mismatch → acknowledge
      (`200`) and no-op, per §6.
- [ ] Outbound: a failing test first for the pure mapping function (job with no
      `tracker`/`ticket_ref` → no-op; `claim_jobs`/`complete_job`/`fail_job` → the correct
      default-vs-supplied comment text + target ticket state/category per provider,
      matching §6's GitHub/JIRA asymmetry; no reachable transition → comment-only +
      warning, not a failure). Then implement `of-trackers::sync`'s outbound half against
      it.
- [ ] Wire the outbound half into `crates/of-mcp/src/tools/jobs.rs`'s `claim_jobs`/
      `complete_job`/`fail_job`: **after** the existing `Tx` commits and the MCP response
      value is already computed, resolve the binding/connection in a short read-only `Tx`,
      release it, make the tracker HTTP call outside any `Tx`, then open a short follow-up
      `Tx` to write `remote_revision` (+ a rotated JIRA `encrypted_credentials`, if any)
      and commit. A tracker-write failure is logged at error level and does **not** fail
      the tool call or roll back anything already committed.
- [ ] JIRA refresh-token write-back: on a rotated token, `upsert_connection` the new
      `encrypted_credentials` in the same short follow-up `Tx` that writes
      `remote_revision`.
- [ ] GitHub `installation_id` bridging: `external_id.parse::<i64>()`, failing loudly
      (`Error::Invalid`, naming the connection) rather than panicking or silently
      defaulting.
- [ ] Recorded-fixture tests for the extended `IssueSnapshot` fields and the new JIRA
      transition calls (no live network), per this crate's existing testing convention.
- [ ] `cargo test -p of-core`, `cargo test -p of-trackers`, `cargo test -p of-mcp --test tools`,
      `cargo test -p of-web`, `cargo test --workspace`, clippy, fmt.
- [ ] Commit.

## Task 5 — `link_ticket` / `sync_ticket` MCP tools ✅ (PR #26)

**Spec:** `docs/specs/2026-09-03-of-trackers-design.md` §7 — read it first, it resolves
the per-job-vs-repo-binding question and specifies exact error/billing/output shapes.

**Files:** `crates/of-core/src/jobs.rs`, `crates/of-core/src/error.rs`,
`crates/of-core/tests/isolation.rs`, `crates/of-core/tests/jobs.rs`,
`crates/of-mcp/src/tools/jobs.rs`, `crates/of-mcp/src/tools/mod.rs`,
`crates/of-billing/src/classify.rs`, `crates/of-mcp/tests/tools.rs`.

- [ ] `Error::TicketAlreadyLinked { ticket_ref: String, job: JobId }` in
      `crates/of-core/src/error.rs` — `code()` → `"ticket_already_linked"`, message per §7,
      `retriable()` → `false`.
- [ ] Failing test first: `crates/of-core/tests/jobs.rs` — `link_ticket_sets_tracker_and_ticket_ref`,
      `link_ticket_clears_stale_remote_revision_on_relink`,
      `link_ticket_on_a_ticket_another_live_job_holds_returns_ticket_already_linked`,
      `link_ticket_rejects_a_blank_ticket_ref`. Run `cargo test -p of-core --test jobs` and
      confirm they fail to compile/fail (no `link_ticket` yet).
- [ ] Implement `jobs::link_ticket(tx, id, tracker, ticket_ref) -> Result<Job>` in
      `crates/of-core/src/jobs.rs`: `UPDATE jobs SET tracker = $3, ticket_ref = $4,
      remote_revision = NULL WHERE org_id = $1 AND id = $2 RETURNING …`, wrapped in
      `SAVEPOINT`/`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` to catch the unique-violation on
      `0015_jobs_ticket_ref_uniqueness.sql`'s existing partial index, then look up the
      existing holder (reuse `get_job_by_ticket_for_repo`) and return
      `Error::TicketAlreadyLinked`. `Error::JobNotFound` if the UPDATE returns no rows.
      `Error::Invalid` if `ticket_ref.trim().is_empty()`.
- [ ] Cross-org negative test in `crates/of-core/tests/isolation.rs` —
      `link_ticket_cannot_touch_another_orgs_job` (per Load-Bearing Invariant 1; `jobs` is
      already RLS-governed, no new policy needed, just the test).
- [ ] Run the Task 5 `of-core` tests above; confirm green.
- [ ] Refactor `crates/of-mcp/src/tools/jobs.rs`: factor `sync_job_after_transition`'s
      binding-resolution block (the `resolve_binding` + `get_connection` step) into its own
      private helper returning `enum BindingLookup { NotConfigured, Broken,
      Ready(TrackerBinding, TrackerConnection) }` (`Broken` keeps the existing
      log-and-continue invariant-violation case distinct from an ordinary "nothing
      configured" gap). Update `sync_job_after_transition` to call it and keep mapping both
      `NotConfigured` and `Broken` to `Ok(())` exactly as today (no behavior change for
      `claim_jobs`/`complete_job`/`fail_job`) — run `cargo test -p of-mcp --test tools` to
      confirm no regression before proceeding.
- [ ] New `#[tool(...)]` method `link_ticket` in the same `impl` block: args
      `{job: JobId, tracker: Tracker, ticket_ref: String}`, `scope::TRACKERS` (add
      `pub const TRACKERS: &str = "trackers";` to `crates/of-mcp/src/tools/mod.rs`'s
      `scope` module first), charges inside the same `Tx` as the `jobs::link_ticket` call
      (standard "charge before the work, same Tx" shape), returns `out::JobOut`. Tool
      description written for an LLM caller per house style.
- [ ] New `#[tool(...)]` method `sync_ticket`: args `{job: JobId}`. Reads the job in an
      uncharged `Tx`; `Error::Invalid` if `tracker`/`ticket_ref` unset (pointing at
      `link_ticket`) or if `Status` is `Pending`; maps current `Status` →
      `JobTransition`/`detail` per §7's table; calls the shared `BindingLookup` helper and
      returns `Error::Invalid` on `NotConfigured` (pointing at binding setup) or `Broken`
      (naming it a data-integrity problem needing an operator, not a retry) rather than
      the silent no-op `sync_job_after_transition` uses; calls
      `sync_github_job`/`sync_jira_job` and propagates their `Err` as the tool's error;
      on success, writes back `remote_revision`/rotated credentials in its own short `Tx`,
      which commits unconditionally *before* charging is attempted, then charges in a
      second, separate short `Tx` (§7's billing-exception paragraph — a quota refusal
      after a successful outbound call must not roll back loop-safety state for a
      tracker call that already happened); returns the re-read `out::JobOut` reflecting
      the post-sync row.
- [ ] Remove the "unbuilt tools" carve-out in `crates/of-billing/src/classify.rs`
      (`exhaustive_over()`'s exemption and the `built()` test helper) now that both tools
      exist on the router; confirm `tools_priced_ahead_of_being_built_are_not_reported`
      either still passes vacuously or is removed if it no longer has a case to cover.
- [ ] Add `"link_ticket"`/`"sync_ticket"` to `crates/of-mcp/tests/tools.rs`'s
      `the_advertised_surface_is_exactly_what_the_design_specifies` expected list; confirm
      `every_tool_has_a_price` passes without the carve-out.
- [ ] Recorded-fixture / unit tests for `sync_ticket`'s transition-derivation mapping and
      its no-binding / not-configured / outbound-failure error paths (no live network),
      matching this crate's existing testing convention.
- [ ] `cargo test -p of-core --test jobs`, `cargo test -p of-core --test isolation`,
      `cargo test -p of-mcp --test tools`, `cargo test -p of-billing`,
      `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
      `cargo fmt --all`.
- [ ] Commit.

## Task 6 — Console UI: tracker connections + bindings ✅

**Files:** `web/src/routes/o/[org]/settings/...` (org-level connection binding),
`web/src/routes/o/[org]/repos/[repo]/...` (repo-level tracker binding), `of-web`'s
`catalog.rs` if new read/write REST routes are needed (the console API stays read-only
over the *queue* specifically — a tracker-connection admin action is not a queue write,
same as existing repo-registration console flows).

- [x] Bind GitHub App installation / JIRA site at the org level (admin-only, `OrgCtx::require_admin`).
- [x] Set a repo's tracker binding (project key / owner-repo) from the repo settings page.
- [x] `npm run check && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`.
- [x] Commit.

**Out-of-band reminders for whichever task lands last:** confirm `OF_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
and any other new `OF_*` vars are documented in `.env.example` with the *why*, and that
`Config::from_env` errors (never silently defaults) on an unparseable value.
